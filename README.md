# Tetherball prototype application using Backbone.js, Twitter Bootstrap, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB #

Tetherball is a loyalty/incentive mobile application that drives consumer behavior through a points/rewards system. Points are awarded to customers based on merchant-driven actions, such as walking into their place of business, making a purchase, or engaging in desired social behaviors. Rewards may be provided in digital or physical medium, such as digital gift cards powered by Giftango. The necessary support infrastructure for this mobile application (web-based Admin front end, back-end data store, etc) are also included in the scope of this project.
